Git Prompt Kit uses Roman Perepelitsa's [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus) accelerated alternative to Git's status commands.

Showing "dimmed" components was inspired by Arialdo Martini's [oh-my-git](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git), which leaves space for inactive symbols.

The default symbol set's using `git status`'s short format was inspired by Michael Allen's [git-radar](https://github.com/michaeldfallen/git-radar).

Splash card font is Beon by [Bastien Sozeau](http://sozoo.fr/).
