Shell plugin manager is the recommended installation method.

## With a shell plugin manager

1. Install `olets/hometown-prompt` with a zsh plugin manager. Each has their own way of doing things. See your package manager's documentation or the [zsh plugin manager plugin installation procedures gist](https://gist.github.com/olets/06009589d7887617e061481e22cf5a4a).

   After adding the plugin to the manager, restart zsh:

   ```shell:no-line-numbers
   exec zsh
   ```
