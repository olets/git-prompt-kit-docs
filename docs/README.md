**Git Prompt Kit** is a configurable set of components for creating feature rich, high performance Git-aware zsh prompts (aka themes) with minimal coding. It is built on gitstatus, the same accelerated `git status` alternative used by Powerlevel10k.

To get a feel for the components try the interactive demo: <a href="https://git-prompt-kit.netlify.app/">git-prompt-kit.netlify.app/</a>.

See [Recipes](/recipes.md) for code how to use Git Prompt Kit components to build a high-performance prompt styled after [git-radar](https://github.com/michaeldfallen/git-radar), [oh-my-git](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git), [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure), or [Spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt).

[Hometown](https://github.com/olets/hometown-prompt) is a theme built entirely of Git Prompt Kit components.
