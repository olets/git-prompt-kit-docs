**Git Prompt Kit** is a configurable set of components for creating feature rich, high performance Git-aware zsh prompts (aka themes) with minimal coding. It is built on gitstatus, the same accelerated `git status` alternative used by Powerlevel10k.

:::tip
To get a feel for the components try the interactive [demo](demo.md).

Interested in the idea but don't want to build your own? Want to build your own and interested in referring to a full-featured example? Check out
[Hometown](https://next.hometown-prompt.olets.dev), a zsh theme (aka prompt) built almost entirely of Git Prompt Kit components.

See [Recipes](/recipes.md) for code how to use Git Prompt Kit components to build a high-performance prompt styled after [git-radar](https://github.com/michaeldfallen/git-radar), [oh-my-git](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git), [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure), or [Spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt).
